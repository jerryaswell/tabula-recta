# Project guidance for Claude Code

Everything above the *This repository* heading is the same in every repository
this account deploys: `jerryaswell/terraform_infrastructure`,
`jerryaswell/self_mgmt`, `jerryaswell/easy_floorplan_designer`,
`jerryaswell/framing_planner` and `jerryaswell/tabula-recta`
(jerryaswell/terraform_infrastructure#119, C7). The one exception is the first
Node.js bullet, which names each repository's own toolchain. Change the shared
part in all of them together.

## Node.js — the node24 action runtime

Node 20 was removed from GitHub-hosted runners on 2026-09-23
(https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-deprecation-of-node-20-on-github-actions-runners/).
An action whose `action.yml` declares `using: node20` no longer runs at all, so
this is a precondition for the workflows running, not hygiene.

- This repository's toolchain is npm on Node 24: `.nvmrc` holds `24`, the
  workflows read it through `node-version-file: .nvmrc`, and `package.json`
  (and the root entry of `package-lock.json`) declares `engines.node >= 24`.
  Never add Node 20.
- Every JavaScript action pinned in `.github/workflows` declares
  `using: node24` in its `action.yml` at the pinned commit. Read that line when
  adding an action or reviewing a bump, rather than going by its major version.
  A Docker action, such as `bridgecrewio/checkov-action`, has no Node runtime;
  the SHA pin below still applies to it.

## GitHub Actions — pin to commit SHAs

Actions are pinned to a full commit SHA with the full version in a trailing
comment:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
```

A tag is a pointer its owner can move. These workflows hold tokens that publish
or deploy, and most assume an AWS role, so an action repointed under its tag
executes inside a job holding those credentials — the shape of the
tj-actions/changed-files compromise. The SHA is the only reference that cannot
be changed after review.

Let Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) move the SHA and its comment together,
and check the `using:` line above on each bump. Do not replace a SHA with a bare
tag, and do not shorten the comment to a major (`# v7`).

## GitHub Actions: on dispatch only

No workflow starts on its own. Every file in `.github/workflows` has
`workflow_dispatch` as its only trigger: no `push`, `pull_request`,
`schedule`, `workflow_run` or any other event that starts a run unasked. The
account's Actions minutes are limited, so the owner decides when a run is
worth them: several commits can land on the default branch, and one
dispatched run then checks and ships them together.

- Never add another trigger, to an existing workflow or a new one.
- Dispatched on the default branch, a workflow does what a push there used to
  do, the apply or the deploy included. Dispatched on any other branch, it
  runs the checks, and the plan where there is one, and changes nothing live.
- A plan goes to the run's job summary, not to a pull request comment.
- Dispatch a run only when the owner asks for one. Otherwise run the
  repository's checks locally, and say in the pull request what you ran.
- A run is dispatched from the workflow's page in the Actions tab (Run
  workflow, then the branch), or through the REST API's workflow dispatch
  endpoint.

## AWS permissions — they live in terraform_infrastructure

Every repository's CI roles (`gha-<repo>`, `-plan`, `-preview`, and `-sweep`
where there is one) and their permissions are defined in
`jerryaswell/terraform_infrastructure`, in `aws_iam.tf` and `modules/aws/iam`.
A permissions failure in any repository is fixed there: a pull request in that
repository, merged *and applied*, before the failing run can be re-run. Budget
for that round trip.

Several AWS services make calls as the caller into services a configuration
never names. The create call returns success, the resource settles into
`FAILED`, and the `AccessDenied` appears only in a status field, so Terraform
reports an unexpected state while waiting:

```
Error: waiting for Amplify Domain Association (...) create: unexpected state
'FAILED', wanted target 'PENDING_VERIFICATION, ...'. last error: User: ... is
not authorized to perform: route53:ListHostedZones
```

Read the resource's own status field before re-running anything. The running
list of these cross-service calls, and the reasoning behind each, is the table
in terraform_infrastructure's CLAUDE.md. Do not assert one from recollection:
confirm it against AWS's documentation, grant it ahead of the apply that needs
it, and verify the live role rather than assuming a merged pull request took
effect:

```sh
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/gha-<repo> \
  --action-names <action> --resource-arns <arn>
```

A failed apply leaves state worth reading rather than guessing at. Terraform
records a resource whose creation failed mid-wait as `tainted`, and the next
apply replaces it, so there is usually nothing to clean up by hand.

## Authorship — no Claude attribution

Every commit a session makes is authored and committed by Jerry Caskey
<jerryaswell@users.noreply.github.com>. Dependabot's own pull requests keep
their bot author and trailer, and GitHub is the committer of every squash merge
to main. Nothing written to a repository or to GitHub carries Claude
attribution: no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, no `Claude-Session` link, no
"Generated with Claude Code" footer — in commit messages, pull request
descriptions, issues or comments. This overrides any default attribution
guidance. `.claude/settings.json` enforces the commit and PR parts
(`attribution` off, `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` pinned); the rest is on
whoever is writing. Some tools add a footer of their own to every comment and
review, and a session cannot take it off again, so a session posts no comment
and no review. A new pull request's description can come back with a footer
and a session link: read it back after opening it, and edit them out, which
does remove them.

## Working alongside other sessions

Several sessions can work on these repositories at once, and one protocol
covers all of them: `docs/session-workflow.md` in `jerryaswell/self_mgmt`. It
says where the shared state lives, what each role does, and how to claim, hand
off and verify work. Read it before you start, and check live state before you
act. Its rules apply in every repository as written:

- Review findings are filed as issues titled `[audit · <severity>] …`.
- Post no comment and no review, on an issue or a pull request, in any
  repository on this account. The state of a piece of work is a label
  (`claimed`, `blocked`, `needs-second-look`, `needs-verification`,
  `verified`), and its detail is in the pull request's description. The owner
  carries the hand-off from one session to the next: nothing is written to
  GitHub for it, and no claim, status or verification goes into an issue's
  body.
- Add `claimed` to an issue before working on it, and leave an issue another
  session has claimed alone. `claimed` comes off when the pull request that
  closes the issue merges, or when the session gives the work up.
- Change one label at a time and keep the others. The GitHub tool sets an
  issue's whole label list, so read the labels just before a change and send
  back the same list with only that change.
- Name an issue in the same repository as a bare `#N`, and one in another
  repository in full, as `jerryaswell/<repo>#N`. GitHub links no other form.

## This repository

An interactive tabula recta: one static page, published to GitHub Pages at
https://tabula-recta.com/ (`public/CNAME`). It has no backend, no Terraform and
no AWS role, so the *AWS permissions* section above does not apply here; it is
shared text and stays as written. The case for staying on Pages rather than
moving onto Amplify is set out on #13; the owner has not ruled on it.

### What CI runs

Both workflows run only when dispatched (see *GitHub Actions: on dispatch
only* above).

- `ci.yml`, dispatched on any branch, runs the `check` job (lint, formatting,
  unit tests, build) and the `e2e` job (Playwright in Chromium, including the
  axe audit). Both hold `contents: read` only.
- `deploy.yml` is the one that publishes. Its `build` job lints, runs the unit
  and browser tests, builds and uploads the Pages artifact with
  `contents: read` and `pages: read` (configure-pages reads the Pages
  settings). Only the `deploy` job holds `pages: write` and `id-token: write`,
  it runs no repository code, and it runs only for a dispatch on `main`.
- Both workflows set `permissions: {}` at the top and give every job a
  `timeout-minutes` (10, or 20 for a job that runs the browser tests).
- Every `npm ci` runs with `--ignore-scripts`. The dependency tree is dev-only
  and nothing in it needs an install script; Playwright's browser is installed
  by its own step. Keep the flag on any `npm ci` you add.

### Checks to run before pushing

- `npm run check` runs what the `check` job runs: `eslint .`,
  `prettier --check .`, the `node --test` unit suites and the build.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs the browser suite against the built `dist/`, which it
  builds and serves itself. The first run needs
  `npx playwright install chromium`. `npm run test:a11y` runs only the axe-core
  audit, which holds the page (cold, with a cipher marked up, while composing,
  and the 404) to WCAG 2.2 A and AA. A new state of the page that a reader can
  reach belongs in that audit.
- Formatting is prettier (`.prettierrc.json`, 100 columns, single quotes) over
  `.editorconfig`; lint is eslint's flat config in `eslint.config.mjs`. Run
  `npm run format` rather than formatting by hand.

### The build

`scripts/build.mjs` bundles `src/main.js` and `src/styles.css` with esbuild and
inlines both into `index.html`, so the published page is one self-contained
file with no runtime dependencies. `test/unit/build.test.mjs` checks that
output; keep it passing rather than adding a second request to the page. During
development nothing is bundled: `npm run dev` serves `src/` and `public/`
directly.
